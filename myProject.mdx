🎓 Excited to share the video of my Capstone project presentation, "The Tech Chef"! 🍽️📱

In this project, I had the incredible opportunity to combine my passion for technology and culinary arts. The Tech Chef is an innovative platform that brings together food enthusiasts, chefs, and technology to revolutionize the cooking experience. 🌟

Throughout my Capstone journey, I developed a mobile application that offers a seamless cooking experience. From personalized recipe recommendations based on dietary preferences to step-by-step video tutorials, The Tech Chef aims to empower aspiring cooks and seasoned chefs alike. 📲🍳

I want to express my deepest gratitude to my advisors, mentors, and fellow classmates for their support and guidance throughout this project. 🙏 The invaluable knowledge and skills I've gained have truly prepared me for the next chapter in my career.

I invite you all to watch the video and join me in celebrating the culmination of months of hard work and dedication. Your feedback and support mean the world to me! 🎉
